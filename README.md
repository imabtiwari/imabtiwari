## About me :man:

An *IT consultant*; I solve business problems with IT solutions. I am passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. I love to talk about technologies. I am driven by my intellectual curiosity to find the answers to the most pressing questions. Whether itâ€™s finding a perfect song in my playlist or finding solutions to the project(s).
 
I occasionally blog and tweet about technologies.
